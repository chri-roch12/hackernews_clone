# Hacker News Search clone

This project is a light single page app using the reactJS framework. It interacts with Hacker News's API to return articles based on a keyword search.

The results are displayed in a table, which can then be sorted by several categories. This table includes pagination action, as well as client-side caching for optimal render speeds.
